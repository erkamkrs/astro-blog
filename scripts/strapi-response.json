A corner kick, not just a play, but a statement - curved with the finesse of a maestro. Each assist, a masterstroke, slicing through defenses like a knife through silk. The Argentine, a connoisseur of the beautiful game, weaves magic in every touch. Di María, not just playing football, but redefining it, showing the world that class is ageless, and brilliance, timeless.",
